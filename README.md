# SMART Patient Data Analytics

A SMART on FHIR app that allows doctors to view analytics for patient-generated health data

## Downloading and Running the Project

To download and run the project, simply run the commands
```
git clone https://github.com/jason-crowley/smart-patient-data.git
cd smart-patient-data && npm start
```
from your terminal.

## Launching the App

To launch the app in an EHR context, first make sure that the app is running on port 3000 by typing `npm start` in the root of the downloaded project directory.
Then, go to the [SMART Launcher](http://launch.smarthealthit.org/), and ensure that **Provider EHR Launch** is selected under **Launch Type** and that **R4** is the selected **FHIR Version**.
Next, type in your desired patient id(s) under **Patient(s)**, or click the dropdown button to select a patient from the patient browser. Note that if you type multiple patient ids, the launcher
will prompt you to pick one patient during the launch flow. Finally, enter `http://localhost:3000` into the **App Launch URL** field and click 'Launch App!' to open the app in an EHR context!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
